    --- You must delete this example to proceed. ---
In the near term, I will engage in language learning with a daily regimen focusing on mastering conversational Spanish.
I am embarking on a journey to be able to communicate confidently with the Spanish-speaking community, making real connections that I previously couldn't.
The aim is for a trip during which I will use these skills by my birthday this year.
