Decide on how to spend your time with tawi and taskwarrior. Here's how.

First, write out two to eight things you're devoted to: `tawi devotions`
You should keep this document updated, but it won't change often.
Small adjustments perhaps once a week.
Make bigger changes something like monthly or quarterly as needed.

Each day, write your intentions (`tawi new`) connecting them to devotions.
With `tawi set`, you make your intentions for the day official.
Then use taskwarrior to check them off as you go.
At the day's end (or next morning), reflect with `tawi reflect`.
